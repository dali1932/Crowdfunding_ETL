# Crowdfunding ETL
These are the sources we used to help write our codes: [QuickDBD](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) and BCS â€” watching our cloud recordings, using instructor activity solutions and the class activities as references.

## Crowdfunding Data Processing
This repository contains Python scripts for processing crowdfunding data extracted from an Excel file named crowdfunding.xlsx. The scripts utilize pandas, a powerful data manipulation library, to organize and transform the raw data into structured CSV files. Below are the steps followed in this data processing pipeline:

## ETL_Mini_Project_AChand_DChen_DJindal.ipynb
We were given two options to create the contacts dataframe using pandas or regex and our group chose to use pandas (option 1).

### Dependencies
* **pandas:** A Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
* **numpy:** A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

Make sure to install these dependencies before running the scripts.

### 1. Extracting Data
* The data from crowdfunding.xlsx is read into a Pandas DataFrame named crowdfunding_info_df.
* A summary of the DataFrame's structure is displayed using the info() method.
### 2. Creating Category and Subcategory DataFrames
Two DataFrames, category.csv and subcategory.csv, are created from the original data:
- **Category DataFrame:** Contains sequential category IDs and category names.
- **Subcategory DataFrame:** Contains sequential subcategory IDs and subcategory names.
### 3. Campaign DataFrame
A Campaign DataFrame (campaign.csv) is constructed from the original data with the following columns:
- cf_id
- contact_id
- company_name
- description
- goal
- pledged
- backers_count
- country, currency
- launch_date
- end_date
- category_id
- subcategory_id

Additionally, a unique four-digit contact ID number from the contact.xlsx file is added.
### 4. Contacts DataFrame
A Contacts DataFrame (contacts.csv) is created from the contacts.xlsx file with columns:
- contact_id
- first_name
- last_name
- email


## Crowdfunding Database

We sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables using Quick DBD.
We set contact_id as the primary key on the Contacts table, category_id as the primary key on the Category table, subcategory_id as the primary key on the Subcategory table, and cf_id as the primary key on the Campaign table. 
To establish relationships between the Campaign table and the other 3 tables, we set the columns contact_id, category_id, and subcategory_id in the Campaign table as foreign keys referencing the primary keys of the Contacts, Category, and Subcategory tables respectively.

By exporting the file to Postgres, we used the schema and import the CSV files to create the tables on Postgres and named the database crowdfunding_db. Finally, we verified that each table has the correct data by running a SELECT statement.
